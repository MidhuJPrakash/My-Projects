              In this book author shares his personal experience, when he was
              working for radio with the Steve Harvey morning show, he created
              his own segment “ASK STEVE”, During which women could call Steve
              and can ask anything they wanted to related to the relationship.
              When author was starting this section he thought it would be fun
              and kind of comedy section, but as he started listening to women
              viewers he realized that most women viewers were going through
              wasn’t a laughing material, they had many categories of needs and
              concerns in their lives that they were trying to get a handle on
              such as dating, commitments, securities, family baggage, hopes for
              tomorrow, body image, in-laws drama, education, home, work-life
              balance and so on. The author says after knowing women viewers the
              one thing he came to know that women want an even exchange with
              men, they want the same love they show to their men, they want
              their romantic lives to be as rewarding as they make them for
              their potential mates.
